# hcalc

> A simple calculator built with [Vue](https://vuejs.org) and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) and [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/)

## Build Setup

You would need to use node > `6` to get this to build

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```

## Vue Webpack
This project uses the vue js webpack template (because webpack is still a nightmare for me!)
For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
